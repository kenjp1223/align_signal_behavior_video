# align_signal_behavior_video
 This function was adapted from https://github.com/Tom-top/fiber_photometry_analysis.
The function generates a video that will align the behavior video, annotated behavior events and a signal.
This can be used to plot multiple FP channels or multiple cells from miniscope imaging data. Example data can be shared. 
Further functionality to preprocess video, behavior and signal data will be added in the near future.
